# FFT
## Demo codes Fast Fourier Transform (SimTech-Seminar BSc.)
This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks I created.

You can open them in the browser on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/juliusgh/FFT (static) or clone them to your computer and run with `Jupyter Notebook` (dynamic).

Not everything is well documented, because it was also a kind of sketch-book for me...
